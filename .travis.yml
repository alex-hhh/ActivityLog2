# Travis CI build and test file for ActivityLog2.  The aim is to check that
# the application builds correctly, and automated tests pass.  The build step
# runs build.rkt which also creates a distribution (in the past, creating a
# distribution has failed due to bad paths in `define-runtime-path`).
#
# Some of the automated tests depend on data that is downloaded from Google
# Drive, this is private data and it is encrypted.  It is downloaded by the
# `download-test-data.sh` script.
