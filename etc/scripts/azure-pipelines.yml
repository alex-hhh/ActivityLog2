  # Xvfb is needed to run the tests.  Since it takes a while to start up, we

  # started in the background, not sure how to fix this.

  # Some of the tests need test data which is downloaded from Google Drive --
  # this data is private and it is encrypted.  This step requires a decryption
  # key which is stored in Azure Pipelines and mapped to TESTDATAPW, but only
  # for builds from the original repository, for builds from outside the
  # repository, the test data will not be downloaded, and tests that depend on
  # it will be bypassed silently (those tests will not fail).
