# This script will download and un-archive test data from Google Drive.  This
# data contains actual private information, and as such it is encrypted and it
# will only be able to be extracted on the Travis servers.
#
# To download the data, the decryption password needs ot be set in the
# TESTDBPW environment variable, this will only be set on the Travis build
# server and only for builds from the master branch or branches that are
# created by the repository author (this is probably a good idea).  The script
# is designed such that it will not fail if the password is not set, but will
# not download the test data either and as a result some of the tests will not
# run.
#
# The script needs to be passed at least one argument, the file id for the
# file to download.  A "-C" argument can specify the directory to un-archive
# the data, it is passed to the tar command as the -C argument.
