;; This program shows how to update gear teeth information for a session, if
;; the device that recorded it was mis-configured.  ActivityLog2 reads gear
;; teeth count information from the FIT file, and assumes that this is
;; correctly configured for the device.

;; Defines the front and rear teeth counts to use
(define front-gears (vector 35 46))
(define rear-gears (vector 36 32 28 24 21 19 17 15 13 12 11 10))

;; replace with the session id to fix -- you can get the session id from the
;; "Activity/Copy Session ID to clipboard" menu in ActivityLog2
(define session-id -1)
