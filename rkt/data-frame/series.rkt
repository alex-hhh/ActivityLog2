;; A series represents a single column of data in a data frame.  It has a name
;; and holds the actual values in a racket vector.  A series can also have:
;;
;; * a compare function, if preset, the data in the vector is assumed to be
;; sorted according to this function, and updates will have to preserve the
;; sort order.
;;
;; * a contract function, if present, all elements in the series have to
;; satisfy this contract.
;;
;; * a NA value, which denotes the "not available" value for elements in the
;; series.
