;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This code works on the assumption that a certain route is traversed many
;; times (in different sessions or as laps of the same session), therefore
;; multiple elevation readings are available for the same positions at
;; different times (as different A_TRACKPOINT records).  The code works by
;; averaging the reported elevation of all the trackpoints in the database
;; recorded around certain position.
;;
;; It will work best if a route is traversed several times and won't do
;; anything usefull for a route that is traversed only once.
