;;; AMBIGUITIES in segment distances and times
;;
;; Data samples are recorded at 1 second intervals (or less) so they don't
;; have sufficient precision to create exact distance splits, or sub-second
;; precision for the time splits.  Even a modest running speed will make the
;; distance between samples 2 - 3 meters, faster speed will cause the distance
;; to be greater.
;;
;; For example, when finding the best 1000 meter split in a session, there
;; might not be an exact sample to compute the exact 1000 meter distance.  The
;; code will consider samples such that there are *approximately* 1000 meter
;; in the segment.  So, a best 1000 meter, might find a best 1003.17 meter
;; segment instead.


;; Split the data frame DF into pieces of equal AMOUNT for SERIES.  Return a
;; list of positions (indexes) where the splits start.  SERIES needs to be one
;; of the sorted series (e.g. time or distance based)
;;
;; This can be used to split the series into equal distance or equal time
;; chunks:
;;
;; (split-by df "dst" 1000) ; km splits
;; (split-by df "timer" 300) ; 5 minute splits
;;
;; See also the "AMBIGUITIES" section at the beginning of the file.
