;; to be used to assign colors to grade values for a diverging color map, for
;; an example, see the colormaps package at:
;; https://docs.racket-lang.org/colormaps/index.html
;;
;; The returned function will convert a grade value such that grade values

;; number of colors, the middle color index will be the range -1, 1, if there
;; is an even number of colors, the middle two colors are the ranges -1, 0 and
;; 0, 1, from there colors are assigned to each side using a log2 base for the
;; grade (i.e. next colors are grades 1 to 2%, followed by 2% to 4% etc and a
;; similar thing happens for negative grades.
;;
;; For example, if there are 7 colors in a color map:
;;
;; color 0 will represent grades less than -4%

;; color 2 between -2 and -1%
